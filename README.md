### Description

I wrote this tutorial for beginners who have very little or no knowledge about the winsock control & client/server programming. I tried to explain things the best I could; so hopefully by after reading this tutorial you'll be on your way to making more advanced client/server applications. The tutorial comes with a sample client/server program which simulates the Microsoft Daytime Service, as an easy example of the basics. The tutorial itself is in Rich Text Format (*.rtf) and can be opened (cleanly) with Wordpad or Microsoft Word. Leave comments so I know if this has helped anyone. :)
